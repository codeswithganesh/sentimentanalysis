**Sentiment Analysis Project Documentation**


**Overview:**


This Python script performs sentiment analysis on textual data using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text vectorization, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics calculation, and model deployment.
**Prerequisites:**


Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:

•	pandas

•	numpy

•	nltk

•	scikit-learn

•	tensorflow

•	urllib

You can install these libraries using pip:

**pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn tensorflow urllib**

**Steps:**

1.	Import Required Libraries: Import necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and urllib.
2.	Download NLTK Resources: Download required NLTK resources such as stopwords, tokenizer, and lemmatizer.
3.	Read Data: Read the Sentiment Analysis dataset from the provided URL using urllib and store it in a pandas DataFrame.
4.	Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data by converting it to lowercase, tokenizing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing.
5.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset.
6.	Text Vectorization: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF vectorization.
7.	Model Selection:
•	Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
•	Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
8.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune hyperparameters of the SVM model using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
9.	Evaluation Metrics: Calculate accuracy scores for the trained models on the test dataset.
10.	Deployment:
•	Tokenize the text data and pad sequences for LSTM model.
•	Build an LSTM model using TensorFlow and train it on the preprocessed text data.
•	Save the trained model for deployment.


**Usage:**
1.	Run the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed.
2.	Ensure an internet connection for downloading NLTK resources and fetching the dataset.
3.	Review the output for accuracy scores and other evaluation metrics.
4.	Deploy the trained model for real-time sentiment analysis.

**Notes:**
•	You may need to adjust the code according to specific requirements or customize it for different datasets.
•	Additional preprocessing steps or feature engineering techniques can be applied based on the dataset characteristics and task requirements.
